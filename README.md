To-do list 

The description of this assignment is as follows:

 you are asked to implement a to-do list using HTML, CSS (with Flexbox) and JS DOM manipulation.
The to-do list should include the following functionalities :
• Each task should have 3 statuses : pending, completed and past due
• Each task has a date and time
• You should be able to mark each task to be completed (it’s pending by default, and past due if the date and time of now are greater than it’s initial time)
• You should be able to assign tasks to different people

BONUS :
Instead of manually marking then as completed drag them into the completed “column”
Use localstorage to save the tasks and their statuses in the browser so you can come back to them
